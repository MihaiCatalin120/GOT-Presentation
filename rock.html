<h1>The Rock</h1>
<body>
<p>
The Kingdom of the Rock was one of the independent kingdoms of Westeros until the War of Conquest. It was founded during the time of the First Men by House Casterly, the builders of Casterly Rock. 
Following the Andal Invasion, the Kingdom of the Rock came to be ruled by House Lannister, who descended from the Andal invaders and, through the female bloodline, the mythic Lann the Clever who, according to legend, swindled Casterly Rock from the Casterlys during the days of the First Men. The Lannisters ruled as Kings of the Rock until Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros. King Loren Lannister joined forces with Mern Gardener, King of the Reach, to wage war against the invaders. However, their forces were obliterated in the Field of Fire. While Mern perished, King Loren submitted to Aegon and the Kingdom of the Rock became the the Westerlands, one of the constituent regions of the unified Seven Kingdoms.
