<h1>The North</h1>
<body>
<p>
The Kingdom of the North is an independent kingdom in Westeros. Following the War of Conquest, the North became one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms. It has since declared its independence in defiance of the Iron Throne. It was founded during the time of the First Men by Bran the Builder, the first King in the North. At its time of greatest expansion, the Kingdom of the North included all the lands north of the Neck and south of the Gift. Bear Island became part of the Kingdom of the North after King Rodrik Stark won it from the ironborn and the rule of House Hoare in, according to legend, a wrestling match. 
The Kingdom of the North was the only kingdom of the First Men that successfully resisted the Andal Invasion and clung to its ways and religion. Southern kingdoms fell and some dynasties were replaced by Andal ones and others were simply absorbed despite family names remaining the same - as was the case of the ancient House Gardener. 
Eventually, it was absorbed into the unified monarchy of House Targaryen after King Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror to spare his people from the fate suffered by the armies of the Kingdom of the Rock and Kingdom of the Reach in the Field of Fire. 
The Kingdom of the North, however, rose again as one of the consequences of the Execution of Eddard Stark when Robb Stark, Eddard's eldest son and heir, is declared King in the North by his own vassals, as well as the Riverlords sworn to his maternal grandfather, Hoster Tully, the Lord Paramount of the Trident. Thus, the new Kingdom of the North included all lands historically ruled by House Stark, and the lands surrounding the Trident, ruled by House Tully since the times of Aegon's Conquest. 
During the beginning of the War of the Five Kings, the Kingdom of the North held full control over the lands of the the North and the the Riverlands. After destroying the Lannister forces in the Riverlands, King Robb Stark launched a limited invasion of the Westerlands, in order to draw Tywin Lannister out of Harrenhal and finish off his remaining army.
