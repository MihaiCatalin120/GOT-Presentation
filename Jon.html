     <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Kit Harington (born 26 December 1986) is an English film, television and stage actor known for his starring role as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, seasons one through seven.
He was born Christopher Catesby Harington in London. He lived there until age eleven, when he and his family moved to Worcester, England. He is a graduate of the Worcester Sixth Form College and the Central School of Speech and Drama, where he majored in Theater.<br>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Ironically for playing a bastard, Harington's ancestors include an Earl, a Viscount, and a line of Baronets, through which he can even trace descent from King Charles II of England, King William I of England, Hugh Capet, King of the Franks, and Charlemagne, Holy Roman Emperor. His ancestry is mostly English, Scottish, and Welsh. <br>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Game of Thrones is Harington's first major television role, having previously appeared on stage in the play War Horse and Posh. <br>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">He stars in HBO's Game of Thrones as Jon Snow. He was announced in the role on 19 July 2009. He was part of the initial starring cast and remains a member of the starring cast for the seventh season. Before he was cast, fellow Thrones actors Iwan Rheon, Alfie Allen and Joe Dempsie previously auditioned for the role. <br>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Harington's third audition scene was actually a scene between Jon and Ygritte from Season 3, even though at the time they weren't certain there would even be a third season. After being cast, Harington quickly read through the first four novels.
