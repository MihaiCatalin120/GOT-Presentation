<h1>The Isles and the Rivers</h1>
<body>
<p>
The Kingdom of the Isles and the Rivers was a short-lived independent kingdom of Westeros before the War of Conquest. 
It was founded three generations before the Targaryen Conquest, when the Kingdom of the Iron Islands under House Hoare conquered all of the Riverlands from the rule of the Kingdom of the Stormlands. 
The kingdom ceased to exist during the Targaryen Conquest: House Hoare itself was destroyed by dragon-fire at the Burning of Harrenhal, and the Riverlands rose up against the remaining ironborn in a revolt led by House Tully.
