<h1>The Stormlands</h1>
<body>
<p>
Following the Andal Invasion, the Kingdom of the Stormlands came to be dominated by Andal culture, though the Durrandon dynasty remained in power. The Stormlands conquered and held the Riverlands for 300 years (which at the time included the future territory of the Crownlands), destroying House Mudd.[1] 
During these centuries the Kingdom of the Stormlands was the largest and most powerful realm in Westeros. Some three generations before the Targaryen Conquest, however, the Kingdom of the Stormlands entered into a decline. The Storm Kings had over-expanded, and their conquered possessions had too many hostile borders, including perpetual border skirmishes with the Dornishmen to the south in the Dornish Marches, and conflicts to the west with the Kingdom of the Reach, ruled by House Gardener. Yet the greatest threat to the Storm Kings came from the ironborn to the northwest, ruled by House Hoare. In a great wave of expansion, Harren Hoare's grandfather conquered the Riverlands from the Storm Kings. Harren himself, known as Harren the Black, became a cruel and powerful tyrant, who enthralled the Rivermen and forced them to toil away for years on construction of the largest castle ever built, Harrenhal, to secure the ironborn conquests.[2] 
During the Targaryen Conquest, Aegon the Conqueror landed his army at the north shore of the mouth of the Blackwater River. At the time this marked the border between the territories of the ironborn advancing from the north, and the remaining territories of the Stormlands to the south, and it was also fairly close to the Gardener kings of the Reach expanding from the southeast. This border zone was also far away from the capitals of all three kingdoms. Landing at the mouth of the Blackwater was therefore the perfect strategic choice, because these mainland kings (Harren Hoare, Argilac Durrandon, and Mern Gardener) couldn't agree on whose problem the Targaryen invaders were, each hoping that the other two would waste resources dealing with the problem. Had they attacked immediately they might have been able to throw the Targaryens back into the sea, but instead the Targaryens were able to safely land all of their forces and establish a strong foothold on the mainland.[3]
