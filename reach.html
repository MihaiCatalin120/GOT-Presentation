<h1>The Reach</h1>
<body>
<p>
The Kingdom of the Reach was one of the independent kingdoms of Westeros until the War of Conquest. It was founded during the time of the First Men by Garth Greenhand, the first King of the Reach, who was said to have the ability to make the land bloom. 
Following the Andal Invasion, the Kingdom of the Reach came to be dominated by Andal culture, though the Gardener dynasty remained in power. The Kingdom of the Reach fell when Aegon the Conqueror defeated the last Gardener King, Mern IX, in the Field of Fire. The Reach fell under the authority of the Iron Throne and House Tyrell replaced the extinct Gardeners as rulers of the Reach.
