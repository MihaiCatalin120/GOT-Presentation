     <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Peter Dinklage (born June 11, 1969) is an American Golden Globe-winning actor and film producer who has worked in television, film, and on stage. He has starred in Game of Thrones as Tyrion Lannister since Season 1.
Dinklage stands 4-feet-5-inches tall as an adult, and was born with achondroplastic dwarfism. Dinklage grew up in the suburbs around Morristown, New Jersey. Despite being born with a physical difference, Dinklage has described his childhood as uneventful. His father was an insurance salesman who enjoyed fly fishing, and his mother was an elementary school music teacher. He had a painful surgery when he was five years old to straighten his leg bones, but otherwise, he feels he didn't receive any kind of special treatment due to his physical condition, and felt he was treated like an ordinary person.<br>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">He stars in HBO's Game of Thrones as Tyrion Lannister. He was announced in the role on 5 May 2009 and was the first actor confirmed for the series. He was George R.R. Martin, David Benioff, and D.B. Weiss's first and only choice for the role of Tyrion. He was part of the initial starring cast and was the last credited cast member, receiving the "and" modifier throughout the first season. He remained a member of the starring cast through Season 7. <br>
Dinklage reprised his role as Tyrion in Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series. <br>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In July 2011, Dinklage was nominated for an Emmy Award as Best Supporting Actor in a drama series for his work on Thrones. He went on to win the award at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony in September.
