				<h2>STORYLINE</h2>
				<p>Game of Thrones follows three main storylines simultaneously.</p>
				<h3>In the Seven Kingdoms</h3>
				<p>At the beginning of the story, Lord Ned Stark executes a deserter from the Night's Watch, who has betrayed him. Lord Ned has three trueborn sons, Robb, Rickon and Bran, two trueborn daughters, Sansa and Arya, and one bastard son named John Snow. That night, Ned found out that his mentor died, Lord Jon Arryn, the advisor to his childhood friend, King Robert Baratheon. During his own visit to Ned's castle of Winterfell, Robert recruits Ned to replace Arryn as the King's Hand. Ned doesn't want it, but agrees to go when he finds out that Arryn's widow Lysa believes Queen Cersei Lannister and her family poisoned Arryn. After this, Ned's son Bran discovers Cersei and her twin brother Jaime Lannister incestuous relationship. Jaime throws Bran from the tower in order to conceal their affair. Ned and his daughters depart for the royal capital of King's Landing, while his wife Catelyn remain at Winterfell. During the journey, a physical altercation between Arya and Robert's son, Prince Joffrey, increases both the tension between the Starks and the Lannisters and the sibling rivalry between Arya and Sansa, who is in love with the prince. In this time, at Winterfell, an assassin attempts to kill Bran, but he fails. Shortly after that, Bran awakens as a paraplegic, with no memory of the cause of his fall.</p>
				<h3>On the Wall</h3>
				<p>The Wall is an ancient immense barrier of magic, stone and ice, situeted at miles away from the Seven Kingdoms and it has the role to protect all the kingdoms from the Northern wilderness and the Others, an ancient race of superhumans. The Wall is protected by the Night's Watch, which consist in a group of warriors who swore to serve there for life, without marriage, children or property. John Snow joins the Night's Watch, being inspired by his uncle, Benjen Stark. There, he became friend with the cowardly and intelligent Samwell Tarly.</p>
