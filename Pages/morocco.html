<p>    A few scenes in the unaired pilot episode were filmed in Morocco, but the southern production unit later moved to Malta in Season 1. Production returned to Morocco in Season 3 to film the new locations in Slaver's Bay: Astapor and Yunkai. Production did not return to Morocco after Season 3, and from Season 4 onwards scenes in the third slaver-city Meereen were filmed in Croatia.
    Essaouira - Astapor. The Unsullied are introduced in the city ramparts of Skala de la Ville.
    AÃ¯t Benhaddou (near Ouarzazate) - Yunkai. Some of these wall sets were previously built to stand in for the city of Jerusalem in the 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven.
        Daenerys's army camp was built in the nearby location of Little Barrage. </p>
