<p>The Croatian coastal city Dubrovnik, with its famous medieval walls, was used for many scenes in the TV series from Season 2 onwards. Primarily it was used to represent King’s Landing’s exteriors. According to Executive Producer David Benioff, “The minute we started walking around the city walls we knew that was it. You read the descriptions in the book and you come to Dubrovnik and that’s what the actual city is. It has the sparkling sea, sun and beautiful architecture.” He also said, "the first time we saw Dubrovnik, I was in shock, because the whole city really looked the way we pictured King's Landing looking."</p>
